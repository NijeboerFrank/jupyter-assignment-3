## Installation and Dependencies
This project requires you to have installed the Jupyter Notebook, pandas and matplotlib python modules. We have installed these by using [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/). To create a virtual environment and install the dependencies in this environment, simply install pipenv and run ```pipenv install``` in this directory. See the [pipenv pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) page for more information on how to use pipenv. 

You can also just run the jupyter notebook commands if these are already installed on your machine.
